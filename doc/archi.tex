\chapter*{Introduction}

\section*{Overview of the situation}
There currently is a forwarder system that is used in DIET, in Dagda and in the log service. Althought the core functions are the same, there are different programs and lots of code is duplicated to realize the same things. \\
The aim of this document is to present a new architecture that will fix these problems and offer better evolution perspectives.
\section*{Key problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Code duplication
\item Process duplication
\item Non reuse of objects
\item Main critic point : the \textbf{resolve} function
\item The peer call of specific objects (IDL functions calls)
\end{itemize}

\chapter*{The architecture}

\section*{Overview}
The diagram \ref{component} shows on a single domain a plugin decomposition of the solution. A plugin will contain the IDL, the generated subclasses (headers and stubs), their implementation and the implementation of a connector. This connector will inherit from the Connector root class that will be defined with the ORBMgr and not in a plugin. \\
The plugin's connector will subscribe in the ORBMgr, that will keep a reference on him, and use public getter function to get the data needed to resolve.
Hence there will be only one ORBMgr in a process, this means only one ssh tunnel is needed. Indeed, there won't be 3 forwarders (a diet, a log, a dagda) but a generic forwarder (= a simple ssh tunnel, with possible feautures such as a cache). \\
The (Log/Diet)Forwarder classes will lose their SSH part, and a new GenericForwarder class will be used. It will contain all the SSH aspects of the current (Log/Diet)Forwarder classes. This class will be used by the genericForwarder executable.

\section*{The changes needed}
This is a list of identified changes needed
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a list of connectors to the ORBMgr
\item Rewrite resolve using the connectors
\item Create and implement all the connector classes
\item Add the 'communication' methods in the connectors
\item Rewrite the (Log/Diet)Forwarder classes to use the connector
\item Rewrite the forwarders in a generic one
\item Write a generic (Log/Diet)Forwarder class
\item Remove the CORBA aspects from the (Log/Diet)Forwarder classes
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Tricky}
The tricky part is how to totally hide the specific forwarder function to the generic forwarder. The solution will be based on a factory, that will, if the plugins are available, be able to create an object of this kind of plugin. The remaining problem is to make sure this solution is valid by implementing a prototype.

\chapter*{Other possibilities}
\section*{The CORBA interceptor}
Haikel presented an idea based on CORBA interceptor. \\
The CORBA norm defines the possibility that the users can make interceptor in some specific points. 
The idea would be to use interceptors to route to the right component that possesses the method required by the object.

\section*{Share the ORBMgr, not the tunnels}
Similar to the presented idea, but the forwarder with the main function are kept separated.
