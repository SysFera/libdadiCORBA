This repository is a test to try to externalize the CORBA layer from DIET, Dagda
and LogService. The idea was to have only one CORBA building block for those
tools, in order to reduce code duplication, and reduce the numer of forwarders
needed to bypass firewalls.

However, we ended up abandonning this code, as it requires to have all DIET,
Dagda and LogService CORBA IDLs, and thus created a dependency between all those
projects.
