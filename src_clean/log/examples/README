DIETLogTool is an example of LogTool which can connect to LogCentral
and receive messages from LogCentral. This tool retrieves log messages
from LogCentral and then writes them in a file (filename can be defined
on the command line).  The log file is formatted for a visualization
tool called VizDIET that is designed to show a DIET hierarchy. For more
